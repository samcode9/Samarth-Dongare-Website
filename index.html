                                Cabin Detector with Counter in Binary Format | MIT-ADT<br> 
                                ‚Ä¢I have worked as a Teamleader on this project.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢In this project we have made a prototype circuit which detects the presence of person and show the counting of the number of people entered.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢In this project we have used PIR Sensor, IC555 and 4Bit Binary counting IC&4HC93.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢From this project we learned the different modes of Timer IC as well as we learnt how to adjust the time delay of the IC555.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢We also tried to show the reading in Digital form by using 7-Segment display.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢This project can be used in the classrooms, cabins.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢one of the best use case is, in the waiting room of hotel so that people can get to know that how much waiting is there.<br>

                                ‚Ä¢Designed the circuit which Detects the presence of alcohol.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢NodeMCU based on ESP8266 Wi-Fi model is used in this project to read the analog value given by MQ3 Sensor and display output.<br>
                                ‚Ä¢Got the basic knowledge for coding the Arduino Uno.<br>
