            <b>About myself</b>
            <p>I'm Samarth Dongare,a Electronics & Computer Engineering(ECE) student at MIT ADT University.I have good knowledge in C(programming language) and object-oriented programming <abbr title="Object Oriented Programming">(OOP)</abbr>. I am also skilled in creating presentations using PowerPoint. Currently,i am focused on expanding my knowledge and skills in web development.With my foundation in programming and problem-solving,i am eager to contribute to the ever-evolving field of web development.I like travelling and playing chess.

            <b>Projects</b>
                <p>Cabin Detector with Counter in Binary Format | MIT-ADT<br> 
                  •I have worked as a Teamleader on this project.<br>
                  •In this project we have made a prototype circuit which detects the presence of person and show the counting of the number of people entered.<br>
                  •In this project we have used PIR Sensor, IC555 and 4Bit Binary counting IC&4HC93.<br>
                  •From this project we learned the different modes of Timer IC as well as we learnt how to adjust the time delay of the IC555.<br>
                  •We also tried to show the reading in Digital form by using 7-Segment display.<br>
                  •This project can be used in the classrooms, cabins.<br>
                  •one of the best use case is, in the waiting room of hotel so that people can get to know that how much waiting is there.<br>

                    NodeMCU Based Alcohol Detector | MIT ADT<br>
                    •Designed the circuit which Detects the presence of alcohol.<br>
                    •NodeMCU based on ESP8266 Wi-Fi model is used in this project to read the analog value given by MQ3 Sensor and display output.<br>
                    •Got the basic knowledge for coding the Arduino Uno.<br>
