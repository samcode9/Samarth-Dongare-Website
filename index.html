                                Cabin Detector with Counter in Binary Format | MIT-ADT<br> 
                                <li>I have worked as a Teamleader on this project.</li>
                                <li>In this project we have made a prototype circuit which detects the presence of person and show the counting of the number of people entered.</li>
                                <li>In this project we have used PIR Sensor, IC555 and 4Bit Binary counting IC&4HC93.</li>
                                <li>From this project we learned the different modes of Timer IC as well as we learnt how to adjust the time delay of the IC555.</li>
                                <li>We also tried to show the reading in Digital form by using 7-Segment display.</li>
                                <li>This project can be used in the classrooms, cabins.</li>
                                <li>one of the best use case is, in the waiting room of hotel so that people can get to know that how much waiting is there.</li>

                                <li>Designed the circuit which Detects the presence of alcohol.</li>
                                <li>NodeMCU based on ESP8266 Wi-Fi model is used in this project to read the analog value given by MQ3 Sensor and display output.</li>
                                <li>Got the basic knowledge for coding the Arduino Uno.</li>
